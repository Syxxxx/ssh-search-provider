# Installation

Just run install.sh with root permissions to copy the files into the appropriate
locations.

You may need to restart Shell for it to find the search provider: run the ‘r’
command from the Enter a Command dialog (Alt-F2). Once the search provider is
loaded it also needs to be enabled via the Search pane in Control Center.
